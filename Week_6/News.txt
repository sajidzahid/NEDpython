Some trade economists argue that moderate tariffs, when carefully calibrated, can enhance national welfare within specific limits. Tariffs increase domestic prices of imported goods and potentially create distortions by reducing import volumes and raising production costs for domestic industries. However, an optimal tariff rate can improve a country’s terms of trade by encouraging foreign suppliers to lower their export prices in response to the tariff. This analysis suggests that for the United States, an optimal tariff rate might be around 20%, with diminishing welfare gains observed beyond 50%. Thus, raising current low tariff rates closer to 17% could, in theory, improve US welfare by capturing terms-of-trade benefits, provided trading partners do not retaliate with their own tariffs.

The desire to reform the global trading system and establish fairer competition for American industries has been a cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s agenda, rooted in decades of advocacy. The current international trade and financial systems are on the cusp of generational change, with structural economic imbalances driving the need for reform. At the heart of these imbalances lies persistent dollar overvaluation, driven by the inelastic global demand for reserve assets. This phenomenon prevents the natural balancing of trade and imposes disproportionate costs on the US manufacturing and tradable goods sectors, which bear the brunt of financing reserve asset provision and defense commitments.
