     - Find the sum of all elements.
     - Find the maximum and minimum values.
     - Reverse the list.

2. *Dictionary Practice*:
   - Create a dictionary to store the names and ages of five people. Write functions to:
     - Add a new person.
     - Remove a person by name.
     - Find the age of a specific person.

3. *Set Operations*:
   - Create two sets of numbers and write functions to perform union, intersection, and difference operations.

### Assignment 3: Functions and Modules
1. *Prime Number Checker*:
   - Write a function to check if a number is prime.

2. *Palindrome Checker*:
   - Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.

3. *Module Creation*:
   - Create a module named math_operations.py that includes functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Import and use this module in another script.

### Assignment 4: File Handling
1. *File Reader*:
   - Write a program that reads a text file and prints its contents to the console.

2. *File Writer*:
   - Write a program that takes user input and writes it to a text file.

3. *CSV Reader*:
   - Write a program that reads a CSV file and prints the contents in a formatted manner.

### Assignment 5: Error Handling
1. *Division with Error Handling*:
   - Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs division. Handle the ZeroDivisionError gracefully.

2. *File Not Found*:
   - Write a program that attempts to open a file. Handle the FileNotFoundError if the file does not exist.

### Assignment 6: Advanced Problems
1. *Fibonacci Sequence*:
   - Write a function to generate the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

2. *List Comprehensions*:
   - Use list comprehensions to create a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10.

3. *Lambda Functions*:
   - Write a program that uses lambda functions to sort a list of tuples based on the second element.

### Assignment 7: Object-Oriented Programming
1. *Class Creation*:
   - Create a class Rectangle with attributes length and width. Include methods to calculate the area and perimeter.

2. *Inheritance*:
   - Create a base class Animal with attributes name and sound. Derive two classes Dog and Cat from Animal and override the sound attribute.

### Assignment 8: Libraries and APIs
1. **Using datetime**:
   - Write a program that prints the current date and time.

2. **Using random**:
   - Write a program that generates a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100.

3. *Simple API Request*:
   - Use the requests library to make a GET request to a public API (e.g., https://api.github.com) and print the response.
